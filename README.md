# Horsepedia

### Description
This is a conceptual user interface (UI) for a basic mobile applicaiton called Horspedia.

Horsepedia is designed to be a simple application that enables horsey users to store information about all their horses as well as view event or specific test information. Currently the application is designed for use with New Zealand dressage tests, however could be expanded in future to include show jumping or hunting.
